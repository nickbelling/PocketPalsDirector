# Beat It!

In Beat It!, our teams are going to take it in turns. Each team will select a
game from the board, and that team has to, as a team, submit a number that
represents **how many hours on average it takes to complete that game**,
according to HowLongToBeat.com.

What I’m looking for is the **Main + Extras time**, so - not the time it takes
to mainline to the final boss, not the time it takes a completionist to 100% the
game, but the time it takes to complete the main game and all of the unique side
stuff.

By "unique" I mean side quests that have optional story or mechanics, not
collecting every single Korok seed in Hyrule or every single feather from the
Italian rooftops.

If you’re bang-on the hour, you’ll get **5 points**. If you’re within 90% of the
length, you’ll get **4 points**. If you’re within 80%, you’ll get **3 points**,
70% gets you **2 points**, and 60% gets you **1 point**.

That works in **either direction**, too. If you overshoot, you’ll still get a
proportional amount of points.

Once a team has submitted their guess but before I’ve revealed the answer, the
other team will get the opportunity to say whether or not they think your guess
is **above or below the real answer**. If they get that right, they’ll get a
point too. Then we’ll swap over.
