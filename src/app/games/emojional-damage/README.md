# Emojional Damage

Emojional Damage is really straightforward: I’m going to show you some emoji,
and you need to interpret those emoji to make up the title of a video game.

The questions can be extremely literal, like this one:

Or more conceptual, like this one:

⛓️👫👫⛓️ (Chained Together)

Or made by sounding out literal sounds:

🍲👧💒😮👧🪓🌊 (soup her marry oh gal axe sea: Super Mario Galaxy)
