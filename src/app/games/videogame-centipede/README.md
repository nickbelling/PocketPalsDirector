# Video Game Centipede

In Video Game Centipede I’ll read our teams a mashed-up description of two video
games.

The trick is - **the ending sound of one of them is the beginning sound of the
other**.

What I’m looking for from our teams is a **mashed up video game title** that
**overlaps the two titles**, and if you get it right you’ll get **a point**.

For example, if the prompt was:

> Belt out some of karaoke's greatest hits where no one can hear you scream in
> this Bethesda space opera.

The two games in the prompt were "SingStar" and "Starfield", so overlapping the
two titles makes the answer I'm looking for **"SingStarfield"**.
