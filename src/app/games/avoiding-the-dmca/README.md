# Avoiding the DMCA

Avoiding the DMCA is a game where you’ll identify video game tunes played
backwards. This is our only way of doing a music-based game, because Twitch are
famously A BUNCH OF NARCS.

There’s **two points** available for each song. You’ll get one point for
**identifying the game the song is from**, and another point if you can provide
**the context in which the song plays**. It might be the main theme, it might be
the menu theme, it might be from a particular level.
