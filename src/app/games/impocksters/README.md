# Impocksters

In Impocksters, each player will take it in turns to play a famous video game
**character or personality**.

Of course, there are some restrictions - you cannot say **the name of the
character or the games in which that character appears**, and there is ALSO a
set of **forbidden words which you are not allowed to say**.

This game will be played in teams - you will have **two minutes** to describe
the character to your team-mates. So we’ll start with `[TEAM A CAPTAIN]`, and
`[OTHER TEAM A PLAYERS]` will be interviewing their character, and no one else
will be able to buzz in for two minutes. Once the timer runs out, it will be
open to the other team.

So if `[TEAM A]` don’t guess the character, it’ll open up to `[TEAM B]` for
guessing as well.

Then, we’ll swap teams, and `[TEAM B CAPTAIN]` will do a character while
`[OTHER TEAM B PLAYERS]` guess.

Each player will play two characters.
