# Lightly Steamed

In Lightly Steamed, I’m going to show you **a series of Steam reviews** for a
video game. The **first review** I show you will be **extremely obscure**, and
**each subsequent review will add a detail** here and there that will hopefully
allow you to build a picture of what the game is.

The first team to buzz in and guess the game will get the points. If you
correctly guess it on the first review I show you, you’ll get **5 points**, and
so on until the final review that makes it pretty obvious will only get you **1
point**.

There’s a difference with how we participate here though - **each team can only
get one guess per review**. So if `[TEAM A CAPTAIN]` buzzes in and guesses for
`[TEAM A]`, no one else on `[TEAM A]` can guess until the next review appears.
