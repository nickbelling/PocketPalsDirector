# Screenshot in the Dark

I’m going to show the players up to **six screenshots** from a single game. Each
screenshot will be visible for **ten seconds**.

The first screenshot will be very obscure, the next will be slightly less, and
so on, until the final screenshot is practically giving it away.
These screenshots have been provided with kind permission by Sam Stiles over at
[Guess the Game](https://guessthe.game).

If you buzz in, I will pause the timer, and let you guess. The penalty, however,
is that **if you buzz and get it wrong, you’re done for that question**. Your
team-mates will still be able to buzz though.

If you get it on the **first screenshot**, you’ll earn your team **six points**.
The next screenshot will be worth five, and so on, and the **final one** will be
worth **1 point**.
