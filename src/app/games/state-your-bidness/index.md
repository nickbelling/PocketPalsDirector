# State Your Bidness

I’ll present everyone with a category, and each team will **bid how many items**
in that category they think they can **name from memory - _in two minutes_**.

We’ll go back and forth between each team until one challenges the other to do
their last highest bid, and that team will start their two minutes.

For each item you name correctly, you’ll get a point, but **ONLY if you make it
to the amount you bid in two minutes**.

So if you bid ten and only guess nine before time’s up, you get **nothing**. If
you _don't_ make it to the amount you bid, the **other team** will get an
**opportunity to steal** by having **30 seconds to finish the set off**.

So if you only made it to nine out of ten and the other team can do that last
one, they’ll get all ten points.

My recommendation for this game: start low.
