# Fake News Fact Checkers

In Fake News Fact-Checkers, you’ll be the heroes our world deserves. The
President has been tweeting INCORRECT FACTS about Video Games and that’s where I
draw the line, damnit!

I’m gonna read you a tweet from this "Mr. President", which will be a couple of
sentences about a video game, with one deliberately incorrect detail hidden
inside. You need to buzz in and tell me what part of the text is Fake News.
You’ll get **one point** for **correctly identifying the incorrect fact**, and
you'll get **another point** if you can actually give me the community notes
that **correct the Fake News**. So, there's two points up for grabs for each
question.
