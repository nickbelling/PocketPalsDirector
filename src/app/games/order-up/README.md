# Order Up!

This is a gaming history-based game about placing things on a timeline.

Each team will **select a category**.

I’ll then show that team a randomized set of **10 cards** that each represent an
**event in gaming history**, one at a time, and as each card is shown, our
players need to put each card in chronological order on a timeline.

The cards will be **completely shuffled** each time - even I don’t know what
order they’ll come out in.

Placing a card in the **correct position** will give that team **one point**,
and **once there’s more than 5 cards** you’ll get **two points** for a correct
placement and **one point** for being **one away**.

Once a category is done and all ten cards are placed, we’ll swap teams.
