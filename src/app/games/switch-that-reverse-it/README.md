# Switch That, Reverse It!

Switch That, Reverse It is a quick-fire game where players are presented with a
prompt that is **the inverse of the title or subtitle of a video game**.

For example, if I showed you the prompt: **"The First of Them"**, the answer I
would be looking for here would be for one of you to buzz in and say
**"The Last of Us"**.

Your buzzer will be reset after every second answer, meaning if you guess one
and get it right, you’re **out for the next prompt**, but you’re
**back in the prompt after**.

Each prompt is worth one point.
