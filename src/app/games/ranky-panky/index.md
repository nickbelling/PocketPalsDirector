# Ranky Panky

All of these categories contain **five items** which our players must **rank**
according to **a different scale for each category**. Some of them might be
obvious, some of them are a bit more ... esoteric. That’s the gamble you take,
because each team is going to _choose_ the category they think they’ll excel at.

Once a team has picked a category, the members of that team will be shown the
five items, as well as the scale. They’ll then **order those items**, and once
they’re satisfied, I’ll reveal the real order.

They’ll get **one point for each card in the correct position**. If two cards
would otherwise be in the correct position but are just swapped over, that's
also worth **one point** (basically, half a point each).
