# Tag, You're It!

In Tag, You’re It, players are shown up to 20 of the tags assigned to a game on
Steam, ordered by popularity - you'll see the most popular tags first and the
least popular last. Based on the tags you see, your job is to **guess the game
based on the Steam tags assigned to it**.

I’ll show you **3 tags**, then **6**, then **10**, then **15**, and finally
**20 tags**. You’ll see the most popular tags first, but unfortunately, those
tags are the most generic ones.

If you can guess the game when there are only 3 tags showing, you’ll net your
team 5 points. Each time I show more tags I’ll reduce the pot, until when all
20 tags are showing you’ll only get 1 point for guessing the game correctly.
