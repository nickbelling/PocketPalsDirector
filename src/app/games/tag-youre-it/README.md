# Tag, You're It!

I'm going to show the players up to **twenty tags** from a single game. Tags
are defined by Steam users and are ordered in decreasing popularity from **#1**
being the most popular.

Because the tags are ordered by popularity, the most common and generic tags come
first, followed by the more specific tags that more readily identify the game.

Tags are shown in pre-determined group sizes:

**3 tags** -> **3 tags** -> **4 tags** -> **5 tags** -> **5 tags**

Points should be awarded based on how many tags were seen before a correct
guess was made.
